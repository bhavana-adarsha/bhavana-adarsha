- 🤖 Currently building **IRIS** — an AI-powered women's health platform using GPT-4, RAG, and FHIR because women's health deserves smarter tech
- 💡 I sit at the intersection of **AI, Healthcare, and Workforce Workflows** — the three places where the most interesting problems live
- 📍 Based in **Suwanee, Georgia**
- 🌱 Always learning: right now deep in **Agentic AI**, **LLM architectures**, and **healthcare interoperability**
- 💬 Ask me about: product strategy, healthcare AI, building from 0→1, or why constrained optimization is secretly fascinating

## A few Career Highlights

### 🤖 Duality Systems — *Product Lead, AI Scheduling Platform*
Led product for an AI-powered healthcare workforce scheduling platform that hit **$1M ARR**. Built code that supported constrained optimization algorithms — basically, I helped build a machine to solve the puzzle that makes nurses cry. Designed multi-component architecture and drove roadmap from concept to revenue. Worked on integrations to connect scheduling with payroll, time-off, and clinical systems.

### 🥗 sCoolMeal — *Co-Founder & Product*
Built a restaurant POS platform purpose-built for school cafeterias. Took it from 10 → 2,500 meals/day, survived the chaos of real-world school lunch lines, and exited via acquisition. Integrated payment processors, school parent portal SSO, and Drift to create a seamless experience for parents, staff, and administrators. Lived the dream while I was at it.

### 💼 WOW (Workforce Optimization) — *Product Leader*
Deep expertise in workforce management systems: scheduling, time & attendance, labor optimization. The kind of domain where getting it right actually changes people's work-life balance. Built a unified customer account portal with end-to-end integrations across billing, payments, and data. Turned a fragmented experience into one clean front door.
