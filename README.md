## A few Career Highlights

### Duality Systems — *Product Lead, AI Scheduling Platform*
Led product for an AI-powered healthcare workforce scheduling platform that hit **$1M ARR**. Built code that supported constrained optimization algorithms where basically, I helped build a machine to solve the puzzle that makes nurses cry. Designed multi-component architecture and drove roadmap from concept to revenue. Worked on integrations to connect scheduling with payroll, time-off, and clinical systems. Deep expertise in workforce management systems: scheduling, time & attendance, labor optimization. The kind of domain where getting it right actually changes people's work-life balance.

### sCoolMeal — *Co-Founder & Product*
Built a restaurant POS platform purpose-built for school cafeterias. Took it from 10 → 2,500 meals/day, survived the chaos of real-world school lunch lines, and exited via acquisition. Integrated payment processors, school parent portal SSO, and Drift to create a seamless experience for parents, staff, and administrators. Lived the dream while I was at it.

### API Integrations @ Various — *Product Leader*
Designed and delivered end-to-end API integrations across healthcare, workforce, and POS systems. Bridged complex systems to create seamless user experiences and unlock business value. Integrations span Epic EHR, FHIR APIs, and OpenFDA on the healthcare side, ADP, Paysauce, and time-off systems for workforce and payroll, and school parent portal SSO, payment processors, and student data systems at schools.
